# KNN
Problem Statement
Write a program to use a K-nearest neighbor to predict class labels of test data.
Euclidean distance should be used as the distance metric. Consider K=5. The learned
classifier should be tested on test instances, and the predicted class labels for the test
instances should be printed as output. Use a set of test instances (test data) and find the
accuracy (or error rate) of the algorithm.
DataSet Description:
Use the iris.csv dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris The data set contains
150 data points, there are three classes where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
The first four columns which are shown as follows represent the attributes listed below.
Note that only the first four columns should be used as attributes. The last column is the
ground truth class name.
1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. Ground truth class name: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica
